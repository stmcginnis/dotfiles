# Personal dotfiles

Just a place to capture some of my config and dotfiles.
Feel free to use and modify for your own person tastes.

## Neovim

The files under `neovim` are Neovim lua configuration files.
This folder can be copied under your `.config` dir, then launch `nvim`.

```sh
cp -r nvim ~/.config/
nvim
```

That should install the plugin manager, which will then install the configured plugins.
You may need to relaunch until everything is loaded/installed.
